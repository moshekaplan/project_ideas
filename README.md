# Memory Forensics
* Like, what's the state on integration from volatility to Ghidra ?
* reconstructing OS data structures to truly pick out process memory?
* Comparing divergences between Autopsy and volatility?
* Like, even this only happened in DEF CON 24: https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2024/DEF%20CON%2024%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2024%20-%20Jkambic-Cunning-With-Cng-Soliciting-Secrets-From-Schannel-WP.pdf . But what about from Chrome?

# Disk Forensics
* Reassemble fragmented zip files from file carving, based on published file sizes, CRC-32 checksums, etc. No reason you couldn't do that for other archive formats with similar structures. Implement in Autopsy / file carving utils / separate script ?

# Fuzzing
* Build corpus from existing bug trackers, wikis, etc.
